# transformer_EE
A transformer encoder based neutrino energy estimator. This is a highly flexible frame work which allows for easy modification of the model, loss function, data loader, etc. Currently, the code supports CSV file with array stored as a comma separated string. We provide example scripts for NOvA and DUNE experiments.

## Features

* Transformer encoder based model.
* Customizable loss function (you can design very very complex loss functions).
* Customizable model.
* Customizable optimizer.
* Customizable inputs and outputs.

## Prerequisites

It is recommended to use a Python virtual environment/container to run the code.

* Python 3.10 was used for development (higher versions should be compatible).
* PyTorch 2.4.1 was used for development (higher versions should be compatible). Pytorch 2.4.1 supports both CUDA and Apple MPS. By default, the code will use CUDA if it is available. Otherwise, it will use Apple MPS or CPU.
* Pandas (default dataframe library)
* [Polars](https://pola.rs/) (an optional faster dataframe library). We recommend Polars for better memory efficiency and faster data preprocessing.
* Numpy
* Matplotlib >= 3.5.

### Example conda setup in a Linux system with NVIDIA GPU
Conda is a Python environment manager which allows user to create an independent virtual environment and install Python packages.
1. make sure you have conda installed in your computer. See https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/ for more details.
2. create a new conda environment by running `conda create --name new_env_name`
3. activate the new environment by running `conda activate new_env_name`
4. install the required packages by running `conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia`, check https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ for the latest stable versions of PyTorch and CUDA.
5. install other required packages by running `conda install scipy pandas polars numpy matplotlib`

## (optional) Set up PYTHONPATH
User can directly run training script without setting up environment variables by putting their script in the transformer_EE directory. The following steps are optional.

PYTHONPATH should be set to the top level directory of the repository.

For example, if this repo is cloned to `/home/user/transformer_EE`, then the following should be added to your `.bashrc` file if you are using bash in Linux:
```
export PYTHONPATH=/home/user/transformer_EE:$PYTHONPATH
```

Test that the `PYTHONPATH` is set correctly by running the following command:
```
echo $PYTHONPATH
```
The commandline should return:
```
/home/user/transformer_EE:
```

## Running the code
There is an example script for the NC dataset. To run the code, run the following command:
```
python3 train_script.py
```

## Configuring the code
The config file is a json file. The default config file is located at transformer_ee/config.
There are two ways to configure the code:
1. Edit the config file directly (not recommended as these files could be used by other scripts).
2. Modify the dictionary in the train_script.py file. For example, to select the model, add the following line:
```
input_d["model"]["name"] = "Transformer_EE_MV"
```
in the train_script.py file.

## Logging

Transformer_EE supports WandB logging. To enable WandB logging, user should install WandB by running `pip install wandb` and then run the following command: `wandb init` and type in the API key.

A minimal example of using WandB logging is provided in the train_script.py file.

## More

The above information should help users set up the model training environment and run the script. If you want to know more details such as the code structure, check out the [Wiki page](https://github.com/wswxyq/transformer_EE.wiki.git).
